BlobGivingBot is a simple Discord Bot to hold giveaways in a single Discord Server.

-------------------
Using BlobGivingBot
-------------------

BlobGivingBot is meant for use in the `Blob Emoji Discord Server <https://discord.gg/xTf9URq>`_,
there's no public bot instance you can simply invite.

It is however really simple to run your own instance for your own Discord Servers:

*Note: BlobGivingBot is not supported on Windows when ran by source. If you want to run the bot on Windows, you have to use docker-compose.*

- Rename ``example_config.py`` to ``config.py`` and fill it out with your credentials.

- Install all requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

- Run the bot.

- Invoke commands in any specified command channels using your prefix.
